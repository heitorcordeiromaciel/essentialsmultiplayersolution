# Essentials Multiplayer Solution

---

### Fork of [Voltseon’s Multiplayer Solution](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1453/) for Pokémon Essentials v21.1
### This fork has been merged with the original plugin, future updates can be downloaded through the official plugin page

Since the original plugin is no longer maintained, this fork aims to:
- Keep compatibility with current Essentials versions and plugins  
- Fix bugs and security issues  
- Implement modern gameplay features
- Improve ease of use for self-hosted servers (no Ruby installation required)

This fork has been merged into the official Voltseon's Multiplayer Solution plugin.
