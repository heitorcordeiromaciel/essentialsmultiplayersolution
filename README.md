# HeitorMaciel's Multiplayer Solution
### Fork of [Voltseon’s Multiplayer Solution](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1453/) for Pokémon Essentials v21.1

Since the original plugin is no longer maintained, this fork aims to:
- Keep compatibility with current Essentials versions and plugins  
- Fix bugs and security issues  
- Implement modern gameplay features
- Improve ease of use for self-hosted servers (no Ruby installation required)
